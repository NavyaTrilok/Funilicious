I built the project Funilicious when I was in my bachelors second year. I designed this for children to make learning fun for them. 
I have added only two features/activities for this project. 

One is MAPIT! - Children often find it difficult to remember countries and capital states. In this activity, when a country is seleted, it shows country capital and language spoken there.

Other activity is MathMania - More like a calculator which does, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Learning math in the fun way or to cross check what they calculated in their mind is correct.

I have hosted this in Azure. Link - http://funilicious.azurewebsites.net/
